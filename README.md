The smart contracts behind [saddle.finance](https://saddle.finance) ðŸ¤ 

The contracts are compiled with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/), and tested using [Waffle](https://hardhat.org/guides/waffle-testing.html#testing-with-ethers-js-waffle) and [TypeScript](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#typescript-support).

```
You can connect to this RPC server via `http://localhost:8545` with chain ID of 31337

### Deploying contracts to local fork of Mainnet

In order to successfully fork the mainnet, `ALCHEMY_API` must be set to a valid URL in the `.env` file.
```
ALCHEMY_API="https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/XXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

```bash
$ npm run fork
```
You can connect to this RPC server via `http://localhost:8545` with chain ID of 1.

In order to successfully deploy to Ropsten, `ALCHEMY_API_ROPSTEN` must be set to a valid URL in the `.env` file.
MNEMONIC_TEST_ACCOUNT must be set and the accounts must have some rEth for successful deployments.
```
ALCHEMY_API="https://eth-ropsten.alchemyapi.io/v2/XXXXXXXXXXXX"
MNEMONIC_TEST_ACCOUNT="seed phrase"
```


### Generating GitBook docs

```bash
$ npx solidity-docgen --templates=templates
```

The output in the `docs` folder should be copied to the appropriate folder in the [saddle-docs repo](https://github.com/saddle-finance/saddle-docs/tree/master/solidity-docs).
