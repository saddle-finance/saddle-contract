The smart contracts behind [saddle.finance](https://saddle.finance) ðŸ¤ 

The contracts are compiled with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/), and tested using [Waffle](https://hardhat.org/guides/waffle-testing.html#testing-with-ethers-js-waffle) and [TypeScript](https://hardhat.org/guides/typescript.html#typescript-support).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i
```

## Usage

### Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

### Test

```bash
$ npm test
```

### Coverage

```bash
$ npm run coverage
```

### Deploying contracts to localhost Hardhat EVM

```bash
$ npx hardhat node
$ npx hardhat run --network localhost deployment/hardhat/swap.ts
```

`deployment/hardhat/swap-forkMainnet.ts` is also available for forking the mainnet contracts into the hardhat network.

You can connect to this RPC server via `localhost:8545`.

### Generating GitBook docs

```bash
$ npx solidity-docgen --templates=templates
```

The output in the `docs` folder should be copied to the appropriate folder in the [saddle-docs repo](https://github.com/saddle-finance/saddle-docs/tree/master/solidity-docs).

### Running Slither

[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) is a Solidity static analysis framework. To run it locally:

```bash
$ pip3 install slither-analyzer
$ slither .
```

Slither is configured to run as a GitHub Action and error on any high findings.
