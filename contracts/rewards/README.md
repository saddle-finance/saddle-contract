# Reward related contracts

Set of contracts related to reward emission

As of Jan 19 2023, MiniChefV2 and SimpleRewarder are being phased out in lieu of cross chain gauges.

RewarderScheduler is a proof-of-concept contract that showcases how rewards for gauges can be scheduled in a weekly manner. This is not audited and not for immediate production usage. It should only be used after thorough testing.
